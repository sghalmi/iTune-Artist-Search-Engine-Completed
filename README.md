I crafted a dynamic website using HTML, Vue JavaScript, Bootstrap Framework, and CSS, effectively connecting it with the Apple Music API. Within the user-friendly interface, individuals can easily search for their preferred artists, accessing comprehensive details on songs, collection names, prices, and the choice to download a preview to their computer or listen immediately. The website facilitates toggling between song descriptions and track information, encompassing track ID and country details. I enriched the user experience by integrating filtering and organizing features, enabling users to refine search results based on criteria like price and artist name. Additionally, I incorporated a preview option for convenient listening to song snippets.
